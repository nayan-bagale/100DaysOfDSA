# üöÄ100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (100DaysOfDSA)

Welcome to my **üöÄ100DaysOfDSA** challenge. This repository contains my solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems from LeetCode. Each solution is implemented in TypeScript and includes a link to the problem on LeetCode and a link to the code in this repository.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: All solutions are implemented in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language.
  
## Structure

The repository is structured by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), but you can also follow it by days:
